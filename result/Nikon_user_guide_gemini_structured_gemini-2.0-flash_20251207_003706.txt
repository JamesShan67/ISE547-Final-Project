A136. Press 4 or 2 to change the orientation of the focus area and 1 or 3 to adjust its width. Press J to confirm the settings.

Q137. How do I select a color to retain in Selective Color mode?
A137. In live view, frame the object with the desired color in the white square at the center of the display. Press 1 to choose the color. Use X to zoom in for precision and W (Q) to zoom out.

Q138. How do I adjust the color range for Selective Color mode?
A138. After selecting a color, press 1 or 3 to increase or decrease the color range (values 1-7). Higher values include more hues, potentially from other colors.

Q139. How do I access panorama mode on my camera?
A139. Enter live view by pressing the 'a' button, which will display a framing grid and the view through the lens on the monitor. Then, focus on the starting point of your panorama.

Q140. How do I start and control the panoramic shooting process?
A140. Fully press the shutter-release button to start shooting. Pan the camera slowly in the desired direction (up, down, left, or right). The camera will automatically detect the pan direction and display a progress indicator, stopping automatically when the panorama is complete.

Q141. How long should I pan the camera for a panorama?
A141. The panning time depends on the Image size selected in the shooting menu. It takes about 15 seconds for a Normal panorama and about 30 seconds for a Wide panorama.

Q142. What factors can negatively affect panorama quality?
A142. Panorama quality can be negatively impacted by panning too quickly or unsteadily, moving subjects, neon lights, subjects too close to the camera, poorly-lit subjects, and subjects with repeating patterns or solid colors.

Q143. How do I adjust exposure compensation for panoramas?
A143. Adjust exposure compensation after starting live view in Step 1. You can adjust exposure by up to ±3 EV in steps of 1/3 EV.

Q144. How do I view a panorama on my camera?
A144. Display the panorama in full-frame playback and press J. The camera will then scroll through the picture in the original pan direction.

Q145. What is Programmed Auto (P) mode and when should I use it?
A145. Programmed Auto (P) mode is recommended for snapshots or situations where you have little time to adjust camera settings. In this mode, the camera automatically sets both the shutter speed and aperture for optimal exposure.

Q146. How does Shutter-Priority Auto (S) mode work?
A146. In Shutter-Priority Auto (S) mode, you select the desired shutter speed using the command dial to freeze or blur motion, and the camera automatically chooses the appropriate aperture for optimal exposure.

Q147. What is Aperture-Priority Auto (A) mode and how do I adjust the aperture?
A147. In Aperture-Priority Auto (A) mode, you select the aperture (f-number) using the command dial to control depth of field, and the camera automatically chooses the appropriate shutter speed for optimal exposure. Rotate the dial left for larger apertures (lower f-numbers) and right for smaller apertures (higher f-numbers).

Q148. How do I adjust shutter speed and aperture in manual (M) mode?
A148. In manual mode, shutter speed is adjusted by rotating the command dial, while aperture is adjusted by pressing the E (N) button and rotating the command dial. The exposure indicator helps determine the optimal settings.

Q149. What does exposure compensation do, and how do I use it?
A149. Exposure compensation lightens or darkens pictures from the camera's suggested exposure. To adjust it, press the E (N) button and rotate the command dial until the desired value is shown in the viewfinder or information display.

Q150. Where are the shutter speed and aperture values displayed?
